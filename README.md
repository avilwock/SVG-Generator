## Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a logo with up to three letters, giving the creator the option of a square, circle, or triangle for their shape options, and allowing them to choose the text color, and the shape color.

## User Story

```
AS A person who wants to create a logo
I WANT to be able to answer a series of questions regarding characters, shape, and text color.
SO THAT when I finish answering the questions, a logo is generated with up to three initials, and my choice in text and background color.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
* GIVEN a series of questions
* WHEN I answer these questions
* THEN an image is generated with my specifications
* WHEN I enter more than three characters,or items that are not alphabet letters
* THEN the program prompts for the person to enter the required characters
```

## Future Implementations

* Offer a font choice

* Offer more than just the three shape options

* Offer differing sizes for the shapes

* Adding more styling to the images to make them look more professional
